#Calculator

After having learned the DOM manipulation concept with JavaScript, I finally feel ready to tackle this project. 

Prior to `Calculator`, I was working on getting increasingly familiar with JS syntax via solving algorithmic challenges on CodeWars. I had too much fun, and it's time to shift to a more project-based learning approach.
